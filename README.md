# React-Firebase TO DO List
I built this app with help of the tutorial  [Wes Doyle Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RtJroTMDf4&list=LLPr4G-dB4QrbufUnpdjFutw&index=12). 
A lot of modern-day fatigue from developing web applications results from the number of technologies and services we have to use simultaneously.

The question is: how can we maximize our effectivity with minimum technologies. Ideally the technologies we choose would be established and have great community support.

In this app, I used two technologies — React and Firebase — that enable us to create live web apps.
